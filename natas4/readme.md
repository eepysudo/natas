- natas4 starts off a little differently to the previous levels

- it says we are visiting from `""` but need to be visiting from  `"http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"` in order to be authorized. the way the server knows where the user had come from, is usually the `referer` header in a HTTP packet. since you can send whatever HTTP packets you like to the server, i will try changing the `referer` header to the url which it is asking me to come from. i could do this using the built-in browser debug tools, but i'm going to use `Burp Suite`, since it makes things more clear and easy to do.

- i opened the page in Burp Suite's browser, as it already had the correct proxy settings, and i turned intercept on, to catch the HTTP GET request before it is sent to the server. i can now view the packet about to be sent.

- the packet doesn't contain a `referer` header here, so i will try using the "Refresh page" button on the site, and take a look at the packet send when that is clicked.

- this time, a `referer` header is there, and it's set to the url of natas4's index, but to be authorized, the page says i need to be coming from the natas5 url, so i will replace the url with the one needed.

- i then forward this packet, and take a look at the page.

- it now shows that access has been granted, and reveals the password for natas5
