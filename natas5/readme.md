- for this to be shown, i suspect some sort of variable is being grabbed from somewhere to determine if the user is "logged in". i checked the url for parameters

- there are no visible parameters being set here that might tell if the user is logged in or not. my next 2 thoughts are that it's being stored in a cookie, or that it's being sent to the server through a http packet. i'll check the cookie first to save me opening up burp suite again.

- there is a cookie called `loggedin`, which i assume is what's being used. its value is set to `0`, so i will try changing it to `1`

- refreshing the page "logs in" the user, and gives the password for natas6
