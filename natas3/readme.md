- this looks like a hint to where i might find the flag. the first thing i thought of when reading this was the `robots.txt` file. this file contains information for crawler bots, to tell them which pages of a site they should publicly index in a search engine, and which ones they shouldn't. sometimes, hidden pages are simply listed here, to prevent google from indexing them. so i will add `/robots.txt` to the end of the url

- this reveals, like the last level, an open directory, with a file `users.txt`
