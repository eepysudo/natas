- natas9 starts by giving me a box to search for words.

- it seems like it's finding words from the dictionary which include what you type in the search box. my first thought is that it's running the `grep` command on a dictionary text file, but i'll take a look at the source code, since that's also provided.

- like i thought, it is using the `grep` command. specifically, `grep -i {user input} dictionary.txt` . it seems this could be vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability, since it's putting the user's raw input into a command line without any type of sanitization. i'll try searching for `; cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 ;` . the `;` will allow me to chain a command on the end of what comes before,  and it will run it even if the command before failed. my idea here, is that it will first try to run `grep -i` which will fail, since not enough parameters are specified. it will then try to run `cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas10` which will output the password for natas10 using the cat command (the path is where natas passwords are stored on the server). it will then try to run `dictionary.txt` which will fail, as it's not a valid command. the key point is, the `cat` command may execute.

- putting the payload into the search bar successfully outputted the password for natas10
